**Note:** While we've aimed to make things simpler, always refer to the official documentation for detailed information and updates. After all, knowledge is power!

## Quick Setup Guide:

1. **Clone and Prep**: Get your hands on this wonder-tool in seconds with a simple clone and a few copy commands:
```
git clone git@github.com:yhaelopez/odoocker.git
cp .env.example .env && cp docker-compose.override.local.yml docker-compose.override.yml
```
2. **Hosts & Domains**: To ensure everything runs smoothly, remember to add the necessary domains to your hosts file.

For *Unix*:
```
echo '127.0.0.1 erp.odoocker.test' | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
echo '127.0.0.1 pgadmin.odoocker.test' | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```
For *Windows*, manually add these lines to C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts:
```
127.0.0.1 erp.odoocker.test
127.0.0.1 pgadmin.odoocker.test
```

## The `.env` File
The environment variables located in [`.env`](https://github.com/yhaelopez/odoocker/blob/main/.env.example) provide dynamic configurations to Odoo and the project in general.
The [`odoo.conf`](https://github.com/yhaelopez/odoocker/blob/main/odoo/odoo.example.conf) file is generated by the [`odoorc.sh`](https://github.com/yhaelopez/odoocker/blob/main/odoo/odoorc.sh) script based on the environment variables.

This file is divided in sections, you most likely are going to focus on the `Main Configuration` section. This provides quick access to project and `odoo.conf` variables. The rest of section are container specific variables for different container. (Note: you may find *repeated variables* like `SUPPORT_EMAIL=${SUPPORT_EMAIL}` which interacts with different containers. This is to explicitly denote in the `.env` file that this variable is being shared through those containers.

Sample `.env` file:
```
# Odoo
ODOO_VERSION=16.0
UPDATE=custom_account_addon
INIT=
LOAD=base,web
WORKERS=2

# Enterprise (GitHub User with access to Odoo Enterprise [https://github.com/odoo/enterprise] Repo)
GITHUB_USER=yhaelopez
GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN=ghp_token

# Database
ADMIN_PASSWD=odoo
DB_HOST=postgres (container or external host)
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=my-odoo-db
DB_USER=odoo
DB_PASSWORD=odoo
...
```

### Environment-based actions:
[`odoo/entrypoint.sh`](https://github.com/yhaelopez/odoocker/blob/main/odoo/entrypoint.sh) file is the gateway for our Odoo container. Depending on the `APP_ENV` and the rest of the environment variables, it determines how to start the Odoo service (like local, testing, production, etc.) with different configurations.

All environments receive the whole `.env` file variables. However, some of them have fixed command-line variables specific for each environment. For example, some of them may have `--limit-time-cpu=3600` because some databases are so big that may require a huge amount of seconds. Setting 1 hour ensures any DB can be imported (this can change as needed in the specific project). These values in command line overwrite the ones in the `.env` file.

To bring up most of the following environments run:
```
docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d --build && docker-compose logs odoo
```

Here are the descriptions of each of them.

#### 1. Fresh or Restore
These environments (`APP_ENV=fresh` or `APP_ENV=restore`) will have no database created and it's perfect for setting up a fresh database instance or restoring a production database.

#### 2. Local:
This environment (`APP_ENV=local`) will strictly follow the `.env` variables with no command-line overwrites. You'll most likely be using this regularly.
Use `DEV_MODE=reload,qweb` to activate hot reload when changing `python` and `xml` files.
If you prefer to update the packages everytime you restart Odoo container, you can set `UPDATE=module1,module2,module3`.

#### 3. Debug:
This environment (`APP_ENV=debug`) works same way as local, but it starts Odoo using the `debugpy` library. Thanks to our [`.vscode/launch.json`](https://github.com/yhaelopez/odoocker/blob/main/.vscode/launch.json), if you are using Visual Studio Code, you start a Debugger session and the container will be aware of your breakpoints and stop wherever you need. This is my favorite environment to work since I use the debugger a lot while developing.

#### 4. Testing:
This environment (`APP_ENV=testing`) is specific for running tests (and will be included in a CI/CD pipeline in a future version). It help us test the modules we are developing to ensure a safe deployment.
A `test_DB_NAME` database is automagically created.
The `ADDONS_TO_TEST=addon_1` are installed in that fresh DB.
Use `TEST_TAGS=test_tag_1` to filter your tests.

**NOTE: Avoid running tests without tags**; otherwise, it will trigger tests in all installed addons and we don't want this. For now let's assume Odoo Community & Enterprise tests passed and only focus on the things you need to test.

#### 5. Full:
This environment (`APP_ENV=full`) will install the `INIT` modules in a new or existing `DB_NAME`. This allows us to have a fresh production database replica.

#### 6. Staging:
This environment (`APP_ENV=staging`) sets `UPDATE=all`; this allows us to *update* all installed addons at once.
It also allows to install new packages before the upgrade through `INIT`.

It's highly recommended to use this command to run this environment

```
docker-compose down && git pull && docker-compose pull && docker-compose build --no-cache && docker-compose up -d && docker-compose logs -f odoo
```

This will `pull` the latest *Odoo Community, Enterprise, Extra and Custom addons*, basically, ot upgrades the whole Odoo instance to the newest. Additionally, it will also pull the latest images of the other containers in this project.

**NOTE: Do not bring down & up again unless you want to perform a whole update again.**

#### 7. *Production*:
This is the production environment (`APP_ENV=production`). It ensures no demo data is loaded and debugging is turned off. It also brings up the `Let's Encrypt` container, so you won't worry about `SSL Certificates` anymore! Some `.env` variables are overwritten in this setup.

Take down previous setup containers
```
docker-compose down
```
Repace the `docker-compose.override.yml` with `docker-compose.override.production.yml` to bring `Let's Encrypt` container.
```
cp docker-compose.override.production.yml docker-compose.override.yml
```
Rebuild the containers
```
docker-compose up -d --build && docker-compose logs odoo
```

## Pro(d) Tips
The following tips will enhance your developing and production experience.

#### 1. Define the following aliases:
```
alias odoo='cd odoocker'

alias hard-deploy='docker-compose down && git pull && docker-compose pull && docker-compose build --no-cache && docker-compose up -d && docker-compose logs -f odoo'

alias deploy='docker-compose down && git pull && docker-compose up -d --build && docker-compose logs -f --tail 2000 odoo'

alias logs='docker-compose logs -f --tail 2000 odoo'
```

#### 2. NEVER run `docker-compose down -v` in Production
...without having a `tested backed up` database

Have in mind that dropping volumes will destroy DB data, Odoo Conf & Filestore, *Let's Encrypt certificates, and more!*. If you execute this command several times in `prod` in a short period of time, you may reach the `Let's Encrypt` certificates limit and Odoocker won't be able to generate new ones after **several hours**.

#### 3. Colorize your branches
Add the following to `~/.bashrc`
```
# Color git branches
function parse_git_branch () {
  git branch 2> /dev/null | sed -e '/^[^*]/d' -e 's/* \(.*\)/(\1)/'
}

if [ "$color_prompt" = yes ]; then
    #PS1='${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\[\033[01;32m\]\u@\h\[\033[00m\]:\[\033[01;34m\]\w\[\033[00m\]\$ '
    # Color git branches
    PS1="${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\[\033[01;32m\]\u@\h\[\033[00m\]:\[\033[01;34m\]\w \[\033[01;31m\]\$(parse_git_branch)\[\033[00m\]\$ "
else
    PS1='${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\u@\h:\w\$ '
fi
unset color_prompt force_color_prompt
```

#### 4. Odoo Shell
1. Log into the odoo container
```
docker-compose exec odoo bash
```
2. Start Odoo shell running:
```
odoo shell --http-port=8071
```

#### 5. Odoo Scaffold
1. Log into the odoo container
```
docker-compose exec -u root odoo
```
2. Navigate to custom addons folder inside the container
```
cd /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/odoo/custom-addons
```
3. Create new addons running:
```
odoo scaffold <addon_name>
```
- The new addon will be available in the `odoo/custom_addons` folder in this project.

## DB Connection
- Any other Postgres Database Manager con connect to the DB using `.env` credentials.

### PgAdmin Container
- This project comes with a PgAdmin container which is loaded only in `docker-compose.override.pgadmin.yml`.
In order to manage DB we provide a pgAdmin container.
In order to bring this up, simply run:
```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.override.yml -f docker-compose.pgadmin.yml up -d --build
```
And to turn down
```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.override.yml -f docker-compose.pgadmin.yml down
```

If your instance has pgAdmin, make sure you adapt this to your aliases.

## Deployment Process
Note: the deployment process is easier & faster with aliases.

1. Backup the production Databases from `/web/database/manager`.
2. Run
```
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```
- If packages are kept, install them
```
sudo apt install <kept packages>
```
3. Restart the server
```
sudo reboot
```
- Make sure there are no more upgrades or possible kept packages
```
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```
4. Go to the project folder in /home/ubuntu or (~)
```
cd ~/odoocker
```
or with alias:
```
odoo
```
5. Pull the latest `main` branch changes.
```
git pull origin main
```
6. Set `Staging` environment
7. Set `Production` environment
