# Odoocker: The Ultimate Odoo Docker Framework

Welcome to Odoocker, a game-changer in the world of Odoo Development and Deployment. This tool is meticulously crafted to revolutionize your experience with Odoo, ensuring simplicity, efficiency, and a top-tier development journey. And while it’s rooted in the principles of the Official Odoo Docker setup, it goes several steps beyond.

Whether you're using the **Community** or **Enterprise** edition, this **Docker** solution is tailored just for you.

**Best part of this?** You don't need any prior knowledge of **Docker**, **Odoo** or any technology that involves this Framework. We stick to Docker philosophy: **Use it, then learn about it.**

Feel free to post a Pull Request to continue enhancing this project.

### Why Odoocker Stands Out:
1. 🌐 **Universal:** Suitable for both Odoo Community and Enterprise editions.
2. 📦 **Easy Setup:** Clone, configure `.env` file, and you're ready to deploy.
3. 🔒 **Secure:** Automatic SSL certificate renewal to keep your data safe (for production only).

In essence, Odoocker isn't just another tool, it's a philosophy. So, whether you’re a seasoned Odoo veteran or just starting your journey, Odoocker is here to make your journey easier.

# Quick Setup Guide:

1. **Clone and Configure**:
```
git clone git@github.com:odoocker/odoocker.git
cd odoocker
cp .env.example .env && cp docker-compose.override.local.yml docker-compose.override.yml
```
2. **Hosts & Domains**: To ensure everything runs smoothly, remember to add the necessary domains to your hosts file.

For *Unix*:
```
echo '127.0.0.1 erp.odoocker.test' | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
echo '127.0.0.1 pgadmin.odoocker.test' | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```
For *Windows*, manually add these lines to C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts:
```
127.0.0.1 erp.odoocker.test
127.0.0.1 pgadmin.odoocker.test
```

# The `.env` File
The environment variables located in [`.env`](https://github.com/odoocker/odoocker/blob/main/.env.example) provide dynamic configurations to Odoo and the project in general.
The [`odoo.conf`](https://github.com/odoocker/odoocker/blob/main/odoo/odoo.example.conf) file is generated by the [`odoorc.sh`](https://github.com/odoocker/odoocker/blob/main/odoo/odoorc.sh) script based on the environment variables.
<br>
This file is divided in sections, you most likely are going to focus on the `Main Configuration` section. This provides quick access to project and `odoo.conf` variables. The rest of section are container specific variables for different container. (Note: you may find *repeated variables* like `SUPPORT_EMAIL=${SUPPORT_EMAIL}` which interacts with different containers. This is to explicitly denote in the `.env` file that this variable is being shared through those containers.

Sample `.env` file:
```
# Odoo
APP_ENV=debug
INIT=
UPDATE=my_custom_addon
LOAD=base,web
WORKERS=2
DEV_MODE=reload,qweb
DOMAIN=erp.odoocker.test

# Enterprise (GitHub User with access to Odoo Enterprise [https://github.com/odoo/enterprise] Repo)
# If not present, Odoo Community will be brought up.
GITHUB_USER=odoocker
GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN=ghp_token

# Database
ADMIN_PASSWD=odoo
DB_HOST=postgres (container or external host)
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=my-odoo-db
DB_USER=odoo
DB_PASSWORD=odoo
LOAD_LANGUAGE=es_MX
...
```
<br>

## Environment-based actions:
[`odoo/entrypoint.sh`](https://github.com/odoocker/odoocker/blob/main/odoo/entrypoint.sh) file is the gateway for our Odoo container. Depending on the `APP_ENV` and the rest of the environment variables, it determines how to start the Odoo service (like local, testing, production, etc.) with different configurations.
<br>
In all environments, `odoo.conf` follows the `.env` file variables. Some environments may have command-line parameter to overwrite certain configurations.

**To bring up all the environments run**:
```
docker-compose up -d --build && docker-compose logs odoo
```
Restart adding `down`:
```
docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d --build && docker-compose logs odoo
```

### 1. Fresh or Restore
These environments (`APP_ENV=fresh` or `APP_ENV=restore`) will have no database created. Are perfect for setting up a **fresh database** instance or **restoring a production database**.

### 2. Local:
This environment (`APP_ENV=local`) will strictly follow the `.env` variables with no command-line overwrites. You'll most likely be using this regularly.
Use `DEV_MODE=reload,qweb` to activate hot reload when changing `python` and `xml` files.
<br>
If you prefer to update the packages everytime you restart Odoo container, you can set `UPDATE=module1,module2,module3`.

### 3. Debug:
This environment (`APP_ENV=debug`) works same way as local, but it starts Odoo using the `debugpy` library. Thanks to our [`.vscode/launch.json`](https://github.com/odoocker/odoocker/blob/main/.vscode/launch.json), if you are using **Visual Studio Code**, you can start a Debugger session so the container is aware of your breakpoints and stop wherever you need. This is **my favorite** environment to work since I use the debugger a lot while developing.

### 4. Testing:
This environment (`APP_ENV=testing`) is specific for running tests *(and will be included in a CI/CD pipeline in a future version)*. It help us test the modules we are developing to ensure a safe deployment.
<br>
A `test_DB_NAME` database is automagically created.
The `ADDONS_TO_TEST=addon_1` are installed in that fresh DB.
Use `TEST_TAGS=test_tag_1` to filter your tests.

**NOTE: Avoid running tests without tags**; otherwise, it will trigger tests in all installed addons and we don't want this. For now, let's assume Odoo Community & Enterprise tests passed and only focus on the things you need to test.

### 5. Full:
This environment (`APP_ENV=full`) will install the `INIT` modules in a new or existing `DB_NAME`. It allows us to have a fresh production database replica.

### 6. Staging:
This environment (`APP_ENV=staging`) sets `UPDATE=all`; it allows us to **update all installed addons at once**.
<br>
It also allows to install new packages before the upgrade through `INIT`.
<br>
It's highly recommended to use this command to run this environment
```
docker-compose down && docker-compose pull && docker-compose build --no-cache && docker-compose up -d && docker-compose logs -f odoo
```

This will `pull` the latest *Odoo Community, Enterprise, Extra and Custom addons*, basically, it **upgrades the whole Odoo instance** to the newest. Additionally, it will also pull the latest images of the other containers in this project. This environment is perfect for deployments.

**NOTE: Do not bring down & up again, unless you want to perform a whole upgrade again.**

### 7. Production:
This environment (`APP_ENV=production`) ensures no demo data is loaded, debugging and dev_mode are turned off. It also brings up the `Let's Encrypt` container, so you won't worry about `SSL Certificates` anymore! Some `.env` variables are overwritten in this setup.

- Take down previous setup of containers
```
docker-compose down
```
- Replace the `docker-compose.override.yml` with `docker-compose.override.production.yml` to bring `Let's Encrypt` container.
```
cp docker-compose.override.production.yml docker-compose.override.yml
```
- Update .env `SERVICES` (add `acme`) and `ACME_CA_URI` (use production link).
- Make sure the DNS record of your `DOMAIN` is pointing to your server.
- Rebuild the containers
```
docker-compose up -d --build && docker-compose logs odoo
```

# Pro(d) Tips
The following tips will enhance your developing and production experience.

## 1. Search through all Addons at once:
If you are using `Visual Studio Code` & the **Docker Extension** is installed, you can open the Odoo Container in the `ROOT_PATH`. There you will find all Odoo `Community Addons`, `Enterprise Addons`, `Extra Addons` and `Custom Addons` in the same folder level.
<br>
Using the Search Panel will allow you to look at every single reference of what you are looking for in the whole Odoo Instance and not just in your addons.

## 2. Define the following aliases:
```
alias odoo='cd odoocker'

alias hard-deploy='docker-compose down && git pull && docker-compose pull && docker-compose build --no-cache && docker-compose up -d && docker-compose logs -f odoo'

alias deploy='docker-compose down && git pull && docker-compose up -d --build && docker-compose logs -f --tail 2000 odoo'

alias logs='docker-compose logs -f --tail 2000 odoo'
```

## 3. NEVER run `docker-compose down -v` in Production
...without having a `tested backed up` database
<br>
Have in mind that dropping volumes will destroy DB data, Odoo Conf & Filestore, *Let's Encrypt certificates, and more!* If you execute this command several times in `prod` in a short period of time, you may reach the `Let's Encrypt certificates limit`` and Odoocker won't be able to generate new ones after **several hours**.

## 4. Odoo Shell
1. Log into the odoo container
```
docker-compose exec odoo bash
```
2. Start Odoo shell running:
```
odoo shell --http-port=8071
```

## 5. Odoo Scaffold
1. Log into the odoo container
```
docker-compose exec -u root odoo
```
2. Navigate to custom addons folder inside the container
```
cd /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/odoo/custom-addons
```
3. Create new addons running:
```
odoo scaffold <addon_name>
```
- The new addon will be available in the `odoo/custom_addons` folder in this project.

## 6. Colorize your branches
Add the following to `~/.bashrc`
```
# Color git branches
function parse_git_branch () {
  git branch 2> /dev/null | sed -e '/^[^*]/d' -e 's/* \(.*\)/(\1)/'
}

if [ "$color_prompt" = yes ]; then
    #PS1='${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\[\033[01;32m\]\u@\h\[\033[00m\]:\[\033[01;34m\]\w\[\033[00m\]\$ '
    # Color git branches
    PS1="${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\[\033[01;32m\]\u@\h\[\033[00m\]:\[\033[01;34m\]\w \[\033[01;31m\]\$(parse_git_branch)\[\033[00m\]\$ "
else
    PS1='${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\u@\h:\w\$ '
fi
unset color_prompt force_color_prompt
```

# DB Connection
- Any other Postgres Database Manager can connect to the DB using the `.env` credentials.

## PgAdmin
- This project comes with a PgAdmin container which is loaded only in `docker-compose.override.pgadmin.yml`.
In order to manage DB we provide a pgAdmin container.
In order to bring this up, simply run:
```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.override.yml -f docker-compose.pgadmin.yml up -d --build
```
And to turn down
```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.override.yml -f docker-compose.pgadmin.yml down
```

If your instance has pgAdmin, make sure you adapt your aliases to this configuration.

# Deployment Process
Note: the deployment process is easier & faster with aliases.

1. Backup the production Databases from `/web/database/manager`.
2. Run
```
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```
- If packages are kept, install them
```
sudo apt install <kept packages>
```
3. Restart the server
```
sudo reboot
```
- Make sure there are no more upgrades or possible kept packages
```
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```
4. Go to the project folder in /home/ubuntu or (~)
```
cd ~/odoocker
```
or with alias:
```
odoo
```
5. Pull the latest `main` branch changes.
```
git pull origin main
```
6. Set [`Staging`](#6-staging) environment
7. Set [`Production`](#7-production) environment
